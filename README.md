# Turtle-Racing-Game
This project is a simple turtle racing game built using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The game allows the user to place a bet on which turtle will win the race.

# How to Play
Run the Python script to start the game.
A prompt will appear asking you to place a bet on which turtle will win the race. Enter a color (red, orange, blue, green, yellow, or purple).
The race will begin, and the turtles will move randomly across the screen.
The game will end when one of the turtles reaches the finish line (x-coordinate 230).
If the winning turtle matches your bet, you win! Otherwise, you lose.

# Code Explanation
The code creates a list of 6 turtles, each with a different color, and positions them at the starting line. The while loop simulates the race by moving each turtle a random distance forward on each iteration. The game ends when one of the turtles reaches the finish line, and the winner is announced.

# Features
User input for placing bets
Random movement of turtles to simulate a race
Colorful turtles to make the game more engaging
Simple and easy to understand code

# Run the Game
To run the game, simply execute the Python script. The Turtle graphics window will appear, and you can start playing!
